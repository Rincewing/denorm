Name
	Denorm - unnormify your website.

Synopsis
	perl denorm.pl [-i <interval>] <targetURL.com> <wordfile.txt> [<suffix.php>]

Description
	Denorm requests each word in wordfile.txt as an extension from the target website. This should expose concealed functionality not accessible under normal circumstances.

	For example, 'echo "banana\npancake" >wordfile.txt; perl denorm.pl google.com wordfile.txt .php would send requests to google.com/banana.php and google.com/pancake.php.

	Do not use this tool on websites which you do not own and/or have express permission to test. This is a brute forcing tool and may trigger WAFs when used.

Options
	-i <interval>
		sets the interval between requests to <interval>. The default is 0.5 seconds, and intervals less than 0.1 seconds are set to 0.1 seconds.
	<targetURL.com>
		sets the website to be investigated. The request will be of the form "www.targetURL.com/word".
	<wordfile.txt>
		the newline-separated series of words or phrases. When running, the script will remove any whitespace between newlines before querying.
	[<suffix.php>]
		the suffix of the webrequest. If this is set, the request will be of the form "www.targetURL.com/word.suffix"
